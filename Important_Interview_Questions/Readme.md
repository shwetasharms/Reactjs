## Answers

### 1. What is React?
React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook along with a large community of developers. React is component-based, meaning it allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to create complex UIs.

Key features of React include:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React allows you to build reusable UI components that can manage their own state.
2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript, which allows HTML to be written within JavaScript code. This makes it easier to visualize the user interface structure.
3. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering by updating only the changed parts of the real DOM, improving performance.
4. **One-Way Data Flow**: React follows unidirectional data flow, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.
5. **State and Props**: Components in React can have internal state and receive data through props (properties), enabling dynamic and interactive UIs.

React is widely used for building modern, fast, and responsive web applications.

### 2. What are components in React?
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based, and they return JSX to render the UI.

### 3. What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

### 4. What is the virtual DOM?
The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React updates the virtual DOM before syncing it with the real DOM, improving performance.

### 5. What are props?
Props are short for "properties" and are used to pass data from one component to another in React.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 6. What is state in React?
State is a built-in object in React that stores data or information about the component. When the state of a component changes, the component re-renders.

### 7. How do you handle events in React?
In React, events are handled by passing functions as event handlers. React events are named using camelCase, like `onClick` or `onSubmit`.

### 8. What are hooks in React?
Hooks are functions that let you use React state and lifecycle features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 9. What is the purpose of `useEffect`?
`useEffect` is a hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or manually manipulating the DOM.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 10. What is context in React?
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

### 11. How do you manage state in large applications?
For large applications, you can use state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or React's Context API combined with `useReducer`.

### 12. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior.

### 13. What are render props?
Render props is a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

### 14. What is code splitting?
Code splitting allows you to split your code into smaller bundles, which can be loaded on-demand. This can improve the performance of your React application.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 15. How can you optimize performance in a React app?
You can optimize performance by using techniques like memoization (`React.memo`), lazy loading, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### 16. What are some common performance issues in React?
Common issues include unnecessary re-renders, inefficient code updates, large bundle sizes, and poor state management.

### 17. How do you handle forms in React?
Forms in React are typically handled using controlled components, where form data is managed by the state, or uncontrolled components with refs.

### 18. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
In controlled components, form data is managed by React state, while in uncontrolled components, the form data is handled by the DOM.

### 19. How do you test React components?
You can test React components using libraries like Jest, React Testing Library, and Enzyme for unit and integration testing.

### 20. What are some common debugging techniques in React?
Common techniques include using React Developer Tools, logging with `console.log()`, and leveraging error boundaries.

### 21. What are error boundaries?
Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the app.

### 22. How do you implement routing in a React app?
Routing in React is typically handled using the `react-router-dom` library, which allows you to define routes for different components.

### 23. What is the significance of keys in lists?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or removed. Keys should be unique and consistent.

### 24. How do you perform API calls in React?
You can perform API calls using `fetch`, `axios`, or other HTTP clients, usually within `useEffect` to handle side effects.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

### 25. What are some lifecycle methods in React?
Lifecycle methods in React class components include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. In functional components, these can be handled with the `useEffect` hook.
